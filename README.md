HyperDev is a developer playground that lets you code a real web-app without the boring setup and deployment steps. 

\ ゜o゜)ノ

Badical!

Your new web-app is already running! Click `"Show"` in the header to see it. Updates to your code will instantly deploy and update your app.


# Your Project

On the back-end,
- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env`

On the front-end,
- edit `client.js`, `style.css` and `index.html`
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project


# Handy Tips

You can invite friends and teammates to your project and code with them in real-time. It's pretty neat.

All HyperDev projects use https. No setup required.
